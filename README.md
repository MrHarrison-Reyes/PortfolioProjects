# Data Analyst Portfolio Project Repository 

In this repository, I will be uploading all of my datasets, queries, and other files for various projects. 

As projects are made, I will leave a brief description with the assigned file list below:

## COVID-19 Project
I utilized SQL for data exploration and Tableau for data visualization methods. The skills I used are joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, and Converting Data Types. This was my first project using SQL. 

Files:
CovidDeaths.xlsx, CovidVaccinations.xlsx, COVID19_Data_Exploration.sql, Dashboard 1


## Movie Industry Correlation Project 2022
I utilized Python and Jupyter Notebook to import movie industry files from Kaggle (CSV) and prove my hypothesis that there is a strong correlation between how much the budget for the film was to its gross earnings. I used Seaborn, Pandas, and Matplotlib to run statistical analysis and create visualizations to tell the story of the data.

## GE Employee Attrition Project
I created a predictive data analytic model with documentation and visualizations using R and Rattle that will serve as a report for stakeholders to effectively communicate the potential value of the predictive model can add to the organization.

## Nashville Housing Data Cleaning 
I used SQL to clean housing data by standardizing the dataset, separating addresses into individual columns, removing duplicates, and deleting unused columns.

## TIC Caravan Insurance Predictive Model Analysis
In this project, I was tasked to create a predictive model to determine which existing customers would be the most likely to buy new caravan insurance from The Insurance Company (TIC). Using R, I evaluated several predictive models including decision trees and linear regression. After careful evaluation of the models, I determined that a random forest model would be TIC's best choice to meet their needs.

## Finance Report
This is my first project using Python for data analysis. This project focuses on exploratory data analysis of stock prices. I utilized Seaborn, Pandas, and Matplotlib to visualize various graphs.
