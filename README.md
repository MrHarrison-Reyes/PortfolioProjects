# Data Analyst Portfolio Project Repository 

In this repository, I will be uploading all of my datasets, quieries, and other files for various projects. 

As projects are made, I will leave a brief description with assigned file list below:

## COVID-19 Project
In this project, I utilized SQL for data exploration and Tableu for data visualiation methods. The skills I used are: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types. This was my first project using SQL. 

Files:
CovidDeaths.xlsx, CovidVaccinations.xlsx, COVID19_Data_Exploration.sql, Dashboard 1


## Movie Industry Correlation Project 2022
In this project, I utilized Pyton and Jupyter Notebook to import movie industry file from Kaggle (CSV file) and prove my hypothesis that there is a strong correlation between how much the budget for the film was to its gross earnings. I used Seaborn, Pandas, and Matplotlib to run statistical analysis and create visualizations to tell the story of the data.
